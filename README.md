# Driver Drowsiness De## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of driver's eyes using a camera
- Fatigue and drowsiness detection algorithm
- Timely alerts to prevent the driver from falling asleep
- Non-intrusive and easy to set up
- using OpenCV library



## Project Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a non-intrusive solution designed to monitor and detect signs of fatigue in drivers. By analyzing eye states through a camera feed, the system can identify early symptoms of drowsiness and issue timely warnings, helping to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. This project aims to enhance road safety, especially for those driving long distances who may not recognize their own drowsiness in time.





## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of driver’s eyes using a camera
- Fatigue and drowsiness detection algorithm
- Timely alerts to prevent the driver from falling asleep
- Non-intrusive and easy to set up

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib or Mediapipe (for facial landmark detection)
- NumPy, Pandas

  
 ## Optional: create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gagandeep-2003/Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System.git
   cd Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   (Replace `main.py` with the actual entry point if different.)

## Usage
- Ensure your webcam is connected.
- Run the application as shown above.
- The system will start monitoring your eyes and alert you if signs of drowsiness are detected.
